<h1 align="center">Hello There 👋</h1>

I am a machine learning enthusiast based in Italy. I completed an M.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering where I studied topics ranging from computer vision to dynamic graphical models. My recent projects focus on computer vision tasks, such as recognizing actions taken from a go-pro or adapting to different domains. During my internship at the Links Foundation, I had to modify the video game GTAV to create a synthetic dataset for person re-identification. In my master thesis, I developed a generative framework for synth-to-real pedestrian re-identification using that dataset. This task includes domain adaptation, image retrieval, generative learning and image translation. I am also an inducted member of the student association IEEE-HKN at my university. I was part of the IT-area where I developed a framework for garbage classification. To broaden my knowledge, I am currently learning about other machine learning fields such as natural language processing.
